        The amount of functionality that IntelliJ provides that I (and others) don't use is staggaring.
        The time we spend selecting text using our mouse,.. moving between editor windows to find the place you just were,.. Manually renaming variables one by one,.. and so on, is huge.
        I think we can greatly improve our efficiency by knowing our IDE.

        So what benificial about knowing your IDE?
            - Knowing your IDE improves coding efficiency. (shortcuts etc)
            - Knowing your IDE improves work efficiency. (using integrated tools instead of external tools, or using tools instead of nothing)
            - Knowing your IDE can reduce-bugs/improve-quality since you spend less time on IDE-tasks. (moving mouse, clicking, etc)You you can put more focus on the task at hand (actual coding).
            - Long list that im not gonna continue...

        However, it's impossible to use functionality that you don't know of, and that's the reason why i give this tech meeting.
        Initially i wanted to give a tech meeting about a lot of IntelliJ-IDEA functionality (Debuggers, VSC, Diagram tools, Test tooling, Database tools and Coding assistance), but just going through the keybindings will fill this tech meeting.
